The last time Padma was beaten she ran to her neighbors and called the police. Her husband was arrested.

Stranded in India, Padma was surprised when strangers opened doors for her. PADV, Raksha, Cascade House, and other shelters helped Padma and her son find shelter, safety and peace.

She almost lost both her children to domestic violence but NGOs helped her divorce and get custody

Anand was born into an affluent family, but her husband was abusive, forcing her to resign from her job. "It became a habit for him to beat me up." The thought of her children and societal pressures kept her silent.

During her pregnancy, he pushed her down the stairs and Anand "almost lost [her] child." She didn’t speak up because she "was scared and didn't want anyone to know about it. He made me feel it was my fault." 

10 years later, the turning point came when her five-year-old son stopped talking and had learning disabilities. Anand returned to her parents and filed a case with the Nanakpura police station. They and NGOs helped Anand get divorce and custody of her children. She wrote Woman of Elements, a collection of poem released by All India Women's Conference.
